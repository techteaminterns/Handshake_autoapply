# Codebase Analysis Report — workday-auto-apply

> **Purpose:** Full analysis of the existing `auto-apply` codebase before planning and documentation begins. This report is the source of truth for what currently exists.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture

The project is a **Node.js CLI automation tool** (ESM modules, `.mjs` extension) built on top of **Playwright**. It operates as a single-process terminal application with no server, no database, and no web UI. All state is persisted in local flat files (YAML, JSON, CSV).

```
CLI entry point (cli.mjs)
        │
        ├─► scanner.mjs     — Navigates to job URL, extracts form fields
        ├─► planner.mjs     — Maps scanned fields → profile values → plan JSON
        ├─► engine.mjs      — Fills form fields using the plan, handles Workday wizard
        ├─► workday.mjs     — Workday sign-in / sign-up / account creation
        ├─► discovery.mjs   — ATS detection + "Apply" button navigation
        ├─► fields.mjs      — Universal field finder + dropdown handler + fuzzy match
        ├─► otp.mjs         — OTP detection + terminal prompt for user input (V0/V1) + character-by-character entry
        ├─► learner.mjs     — Self-learning store: records past runs, applies corrections
        └─► reporter.mjs    — Screenshots + CSV logging + queue management
```

**Data flow:**
```
config/profile.yml + config/resumes.yml
        │
        ▼
[SCAN] → forms/{slug}-scan.json
        │
        ▼
[PLAN] → forms/{slug}-plan.json
        │
        ▼
[FILL + SUBMIT] → data/applied.csv + screenshots/ + data/learnings.json
```

## 4. Automation Flow (Full Pipeline)

```
node cli.mjs apply <url> [--signin|--signup]
        │
        ▼
1. Load .env + config/profile.yml + config/resumes.yml
2. Resolve credentials (CLI flags → .env → profile.yml fallback)
3. detectATS(url) → greenhouse | lever | ashby | workday | gem | generic
        │
        ▼
4. Launch Chromium browser (headless: false, 1280×900 viewport)

            For each entry in plan.fills:
              - Resolve element via findField() (6 strategies)
              - Fill by field type:
                  text/email/tel: .fill()

16. Browser stays open 15s → close
```

## 5. Sign-In Flow (Workday — Corrected Flow)

Every Workday job application follows the same gateway sequence: JD page → Apply → Apply Manually → Create Account / Sign In gateway. Because this gateway always appears after clicking Apply Manually, upfront wizard/login checks are unnecessary. The correct flow when `--signup` is **not** set is:

```
node cli.mjs apply <url>   (default mode = 'signin')
        │
        ▼
1. discoverApplicationForm():
   - Click Apply button on the JD page
   - Click "Apply Manually" from the popup
   - Gateway page appears (Create Account | Sign In)
   - Click "Sign In" link/button on the gateway
   - Wait for Sign In form (email + password inputs visible)
        │
        ▼
2. workdayLogin(page, email, password):
   a. Fill email input (data-automation-id="email" | userName)
   b. Fill password input
   c. Click signInSubmitButton (force: true)
   d. Wait 4s + networkidle
   e. Check for password input still visible or error message
   → If still visible: return false (login failed)
   → Otherwise: return true (proceed to application form)
```

---

## 6. Sign-Up Flow (Workday — Corrected Flow)

Same gateway sequence as sign-in. When `--signup` is set, click "Create Account" instead of "Sign In" on the gateway.

```
node cli.mjs apply <url> --signup
        │
        ▼
1. discoverApplicationForm():
   - Click Apply → "Apply Manually" on Workday JD page
   - On gateway: click "Create Account" link/button
   - Wait for verifyPassword input to appear
        │
        ▼
2. workdayCreateAccount(page, email, givenPassword):
   a. Click "Create Account" button if not already on form
   b. Wait for create account form
   c. Fill email input
   d. Generate secure random password (12 chars + special + digit) if not provided
   e. Fill password + verifyPassword inputs
   f. Check terms/agree checkbox if present
   g. Click createAccountSubmitButton
   h. Wait 5s + networkidle
   i. Check page for "verif/confirm/code/check your email" text
      → If yes: prompt user in terminal to enter OTP → fill verification input → click Verify
      → If no: skip directly to step 3 (no email verification required)
   j. Return the generated password
        │
        ▼
3. isWorkdaySignInPage(page):
   → If redirected to sign-in form: workdayLogin(email, newPassword)
   → If already on application form: return true directly
```

## 7. Question Detection and Answering Flow

### Question Detection (scanner.mjs)

The scanner runs **three passes** over the DOM:

1. **Standard inputs/selects/textareas** — `querySelectorAll('input, textarea, select')` with label extraction via:
   - `label[for="id"]`
   - Closest `label` ancestor
   - `aria-label` attribute
   - `aria-labelledby` reference
   - `placeholder` attribute
   - Previous sibling text
   - `data-automation-id` converted to readable label

2. **Custom dropdowns** — `[data-field]`, `.field`, `.application-field` containers with `[role="listbox"]`, `[role="combobox"]`, `.custom-select` children

3. **Yes/No button questions** (Ashby pattern) — find `label` elements whose sibling container has buttons with text "Yes" and "No"

### Answer Planning (planner.mjs)

The `FIELD_MAP` is an **83-entry regex→profile-path lookup table** covering:

- Personal info (first name / **given name**, last name / **family name** / **surname**, email, phone, LinkedIn, address, location)
- Work authorization (sponsorship, US authorization, office willingness)
- EEO fields (gender, race, Hispanic/Latino, veteran status, disability)
- Education (degree, major, university, graduation year, GPA)
- Experience (years, company, title, description, salary, start date)
- Static answers (`_static.No`, `_static.Mobile`, `_static.LinkedIn`, `_static.true`)
- Consent/terms checkboxes

**Answer resolution priority** (V1+):
1. `profile.yml` via FIELD_MAP match
2. Parsed resume content — stored to profile/DB for future reuse
3. Telegram fallback — bot asks user the question via Telegram; answer stored for future reuse
4. Unmapped (skipped)

**Fuzzy matching** (`fuzzyScore()`) is used when a plan value doesn't exactly match a dropdown option — returns 0–1 score based on exact, inclusion, and word-overlap comparisons.

---

## 8. How Profile/Resume Data is Used

**`config/profile.yml`** has these sections:
- `personal`: name, email, phone, LinkedIn, location, city, state, postal_code, address, country, country_phone_code, source, consent_agreement
- `eeo`: gender, hispanic_latino, race, veteran_status, disability_status
- `work_auth`: authorized_us, sponsorship_needed, visa_status, office_willing, willing_to_relocate
- `education`: degree, major, university, graduation_year
- `experience`: years, current_company, current_title, salary_expectation, start_date

**`config/resumes.yml`** lists resume PDFs with `id`, `label`, `file` (path), `keywords` array. `pickResume()` scores each resume against JD text keyword matches, picks the highest-scoring one (≥2 matches). Falls back to the `default` resume.

---

## 9. Self-Learning System (learner.mjs)

`data/learnings.json` stores:
- `field_corrections` — fields that consistently fail (ATS + field name + error)
- `option_mappings` — dropdown value corrections (plan said X → actual option was Y)
- `ats_quirks` — ATS-specific notes
- `results` — last 200 application results with field errors
- `stats` — total/submitted/failed counts

On each application: `applyLearnings(plan, url)` checks `option_mappings` and updates plan values before filling. After completion: `recordResult()` logs the outcome and any field errors.

## 12. What is Reusable for the Planned Product

| Component | Reusability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/scanner.mjs` | ✅ High | Core scanning logic is solid; can be called programmatically |
| `lib/planner.mjs` | ✅ High | FIELD_MAP + generatePlan() are the core intelligence |
| `lib/engine.mjs` | ✅ High | Workday wizard loop is well-developed; non-Workday fill loop also solid |
| `lib/workday.mjs` | ✅ High | Sign-in + sign-up flows are production-level |
| `lib/discovery.mjs` | ✅ High | ATS detection + portal navigation covers major ATS platforms |
| `lib/fields.mjs` | ✅ High | 4-strategy dropdown handler + fuzzy matching are well-engineered |
| `lib/otp.mjs` | ✅ High | Gmail IMAP OTP fetch is working; can be wrapped/replaced |
| `lib/learner.mjs` | ✅ Medium | Needs to move from local JSON to Supabase |
| `lib/reporter.mjs` | 🔄 Partial | CSV logging → needs Supabase; screenshots still useful |
| Profile YAML schema | 🔄 Partial | Needs to become Supabase database schema |
| CLI architecture | ❌ Replace | Will be replaced by web dashboard + programmatic API |
| Queue CSV | ❌ Replace | Replace with Supabase jobs table + queue system |

## 13. Current Limitations, Gaps, and Areas Requiring Changes

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|---|---|
| **No Telegram integration** | No messaging, confirmation, or notification system |
| **No web UI or dashboard** | Pure terminal output, no monitoring interface |
| **No database** | All state in local flat files; not multi-user capable |
| **Single user only** | Profile is a local YAML file; one user per machine |
| **No job discovery** | Only processes URLs provided manually; no scraping |
| **No deployment infrastructure** | Not containerized; requires local machine with browser |
| **No resume parsing** | Resume path is assigned but content is not extracted/used for answers |

### Reliability Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|---|---|
| **OTP via Gmail App Password** | Not scalable; users need to share Gmail App Password |
| **Browser stays open 15s** | Awkward UX; no clean session management |
| **No retry logic on failure** | If a step fails, pipeline stops; no automatic resume |
| **Hardcoded Mac user agent** | May cause issues on Windows/Linux servers |
| **No headless mode** | `headless: false` — requires a display; not server-compatible |

### Architecture Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|---|---|
| **Profile data from YAML only** | No dynamic data source; cannot be populated via UI |
| **Credentials in .env file** | Not encrypted; not suitable for multi-user |
| **No application status tracking** | Only CSV log; no queryable state |
| **Queue is CSV-based** | Not suitable for concurrent processing |
| **Learnings are local JSON** | Not shared across users or deployments |
